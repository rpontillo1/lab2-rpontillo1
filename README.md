# CS015Fall2021_Lab2
Test for conditionals and loops

## Instructions
Read the [general instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i9FJtM2RkEsfi2VbplU7CvaSdQGo8Pf2/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114106275423504535811&rtpof=true&sd=true) on how to accept, clone, edit, and submit the assignment, before you start!

Goal: To test the knowledge about variables, conditionals, and loops

Due date: Wed, Sept 22, Midnight | submissions would be accepted via GitHub only unless stated otherwise. 

<replace this with your name>

In this lab, you would develop solutions to several small problems, implement your solutions in Python, develop test cases, test your solutions on your own as well as supplied test cases, and then submit. 
    

## Tasks: 

(1) Read through the readme.md file and then read through the .py file. 
    
(2) There are too many problems to be solved. Crack each of them one by one. 
    
(3) Spend more time thinking about the solutions using pen and paper instead of spending too much time in writing poorly thought out code, testing and revising it. 
    
(4) Spend time thinking how will you test your solutions, i.e. develop test cases and add those test cases to student_test_conditionals.txt and student_test_loop.txt. The format of these files shall be exactly like the those test_conditionals.txt and test_loops.txt. Please follow the same template.
    
(5) Implement each of the REQUIRED (indicated right next to the functions in the .py files) functions 
    
(6) One you have the working solutions ready on paper, start coding and testing if the function you implemented passes the test cases. For rectangle intersection problem, you can take a look at the visuals here [visual examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRa7gslVYAzl5uP-xv8L6o6PNjPwpBxGz7665a4Atr4/edit?usp=sharing) which were created using [this website](https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en)
    
(7) Try to raise as many exceptions (ValueError, TypeError) as possible. In other words, make sure you take care of the preconditions i.e. test for valid input before you process the input. For example, if your program is not expecting a negative number as an input an if user of your program enters a negative number how would your program behave?
    
(8) Test your code with the test cases provided in test_conditionals.txt and test_loops.txt, as well as the ones you have developed in student_test_conditionals.txt and student_test_loop.txt, and make sure your program passes as many test cases as possible. 
    
(9) Commit and Push (VCS->Git->Push menu in PyCharm) your changes to your GitHub repository (Ask for help from the lab mentors). Confirm that the changes that you have made have been pushed to your GitHub repository. You can do so by logging into your GitHub repository and viewing the relevant files. 

(10) Update the Report.txt. In this file, you will write your approach, difficulty, and what did you learn by solving each problem in addition to any feedback that you may have to improve the assignment. 
    
## How to test your implementation using a test file?
Open the terminal window of PyCharm (on the left to Python console at the bottom), type the following and press Enter:
>>> python -m doctest -v "name_of_the_test_file.txt"
    
or 

>>> python3 -m doctest -v "name_of_the_test_file.txt"

if any of the above command refuses to work, try the following instead: 
>>> py -m doctest -v "name_of_the_test_file.txt"


## Submission checklist: 
(1) updated student_test_conditionals.txt and student_test_loop.txt
    
(2) updated code file(s)
    
(3) updated Report.txt
    
(4) anything else that you think is important for me to better understand/assess the effort that you have put in. 

Thanks!
